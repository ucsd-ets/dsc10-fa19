    "These two lines of code will be at the beginning of most, if not all, of your homework assignments. Their purpose is to import the datascience and numpy libraries into the environment so you can use the functions from those libraries. The asterisk (*) means “all”, so you are importing “all” of the datascience library, and when you use functions from this module, you don’t need to include the module name. So instead of datascience.make_array(3, 5, 7), you can simply type make_array(3, 5, 7). For the numpy package, importing it “as np” means that instead of _numpy_.arange(10), you can use _np_.arange(10). We’ll provide the import statements you need for this class, but since they’ll pop up so often, it wouldn’t hurt to know what they’re doing. :)"
