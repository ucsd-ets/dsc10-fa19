Greatly disturbed (because the Nationals are your favorite team), you start to claim that FiveThirtyEight's model is wrong. But in order to substantiate your claim (as you should since you are a data scientist that doesn't make unbased claims),  you need to simulate the process of seeing 100 futures under the assumptions of FiveThirtyEight's model, and determine how unlikely Doctor Strange's prediction really is.\n",
